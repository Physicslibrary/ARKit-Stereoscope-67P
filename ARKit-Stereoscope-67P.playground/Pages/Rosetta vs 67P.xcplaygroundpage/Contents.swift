 This playground was inspired by a European Space Agency's webpage explaining the relative sizes of the Rosetta space probe to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
 
 sci.esa.int/rosetta/54831-how-big-is-rosetta-compared-with-the-comet/
 
 Question: What would it be like if one could see the relative sizes of Rosetta and 67P in virtual reality?
 
 Since ESA and NASA have an educational policy of open sourcing their data such as 3D models and images, one can use tools such Swift Playgrounds and ARKit to visualize the data with a stereoscope.
 
 The Rosetta model is positioned 1 km from the 67P comet using Blender. There are cubes placed at every 1 km from 1 to 10 km from 67P. This helps to give a sense of distance and a kilometer is a familiar thing. Placing Rosetta 1 km above the comet gives it a sense of scale.
 
 Note: Rosetta was 1 km from 67P on its last mission

 Thank to Dr. Brian May for developing an amazingly simple tool that can be used with the 9.7" iPad.
 
 Apple iOS Swift Playgrounds to access ARKit and SceneKit (set up scene, read 3D files, attact a virtual camera for lefteye to ARKit iPad camera righteye to make a stereoscope, 6DOF tracking)
 
 https://www.apple.com/ca/swift/playgrounds/
 
 This playground is hardwired for Apple 2018 9.7" iPad (introduced at Apple Special Event March 27, 2018, Chicago).
 
 cube.obj was created in Blender
 a series of 2mx2mx2m cube placed at every km from 1 to 10km
 to give another sense of scale
 
 Tips:
 
 If frame rate <60Hz, stop playground and run again
 
 If still <60Hz, stop playground and run again
 
 If still <60Hz after several tries, close something
 
 This playground doesn't look for a flat plane to put virtual objects on, instead the initial position of the iPad is the world origin when "Run My Code" is pressed.
 
 All virtual objects are positioned and oriented according to this world origin (with righteye.debugOptions on, the world origin is an XYZ or RGB axis)
